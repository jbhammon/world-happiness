          <p>What makes a person happy? This broad and open-ended question evokes countless answers from different people. In the World Happiness Report published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, six key factors are gauged across countries across the world to measure and quantify happiness: Economy (GDP per capita), Family, Health (life expectancy), Freedom, Trust (government corruption), and Generosity. These measurements are benchmarked against a dystopia residual that acts as a dummy variable for a country being as unhappy as possible.</p>

        <div class='col-sm-8'>
          <p>While exploring the data, we were intrigued by the fluctuation of happiness levels for certain countries. Two outliers stood out: Venezuela and Latvia. These countries represent the two data points with the most radical shift negatively and positively in happiness ranking between 2015 and 2017. Given that each happiness factor has an associated weight for each country, we were also curious about how one happiness factor’s weight increases or decreased based on the historical context.</p>

          <p>It was unsurprising to find that Venezuela’s happiness rank dropped from 23rd in 2015 to 82nd in 2017. Venezuela’s catastrophic economic crisis related to its oil shortages rippled through the country in early 2015. Its impact was to be long-lasting and devastating as crime and mortality rates, starvation, disease, and hyperinflation skyrocketed (Biller & Laya, 2019). Political corruption was rampant, as was unemployment (Kurmanaev, 2019).The crisis is ongoing and its effect on the happiness of its people is reflected in the data.</p>

        <div class='col-sm-8'>
          <p>Of all factors, the weights of Trust and Freedom reduced drastically between 2015 and 2017. It’s surprising to see that Trust had the lowest bearing on happiness in 2017. Its prioritization of Family may speak to the safety concerns that became more important as protesters were persecuted by the government. It may even speak to the resilience of the human spirit and that family, no matter what the circumstance, is fundamental to a person’s, or nation’s, well-being.</p>

          <p>Latvia, meanwhile, rose from its happiness rank of 89th in 2015 to 54th in 2017. In 2015, Latvia joined the European Union (EU) after struggling with the strength of Russia’s political power (IMF World Economic Outlook Database, April 2016).</p>

          <p>At first, it seems as though very few significant incidents occurred 2015 and 2017 in Latvia. Perhaps joining the EU had an immediate, positive impact on Latvia’s happiness level. The effect of joining the EU could also be responsible for shifting the weight of Family to first as economic troubles became less concerning once Latvia joined the EU.</p>

          <p>Latvia and Venezuela’s rapid changes in happiness level look very different from each other on the outside. Venezuela’s destructive economic crisis, dramatic and calamitous for the country contributed so wholly to the country’s happiness level. Its effect on its people’s safety and wellness alone is sufficient to understand the plummeting drop in happiness score. Latvia, on the other hand, climbs slowly up the rank of happiness with very little to note besides the joining of the EU in 2015. Maybe the protection of the EU from its long-standing struggle for power with Russia lifted the burden of economic concerns and allowed Latvia’s citizens to reflect on their most important happiness factor: Family.</p>
